## How to setup for development

- `yarn setup` To fill in the required `.env` files you'll need in each of the application sections (from root of repo).
  - Go fill those out before proceeding. Ensure `server/.env.development` is filled or else things won't work right.
- `yarn dev:server` To boot the server locally (from root of repo).
- `yarn dev:frontend` To boot the frontend locally (from root of repo).
- `yarn dev:collector` To then run the document collector (from root of repo).
